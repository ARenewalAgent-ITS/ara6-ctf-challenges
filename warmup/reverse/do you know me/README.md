## Description

Do you know me? 
I think I have alzheimer, so I often forget who I am. 
Pretty sure I have a code somewhere that helps me when I'm stuck in this kind of situation.
But this foolish me forgot what kind of code it is and how to solve it. 
Can you help me out solving my code? It will definitely help me in remembering my own identity.
