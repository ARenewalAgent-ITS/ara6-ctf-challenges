Welcome to ARA 6.0 CTF! Import your pwn, intercept the request, strings the binaries, mod the numbers, analyze the logs and more. But most importantly, don't forget to have fun. And after you're done pwning, please submit all the flag to the checker to be verified.

[>] What do you mean all flags, even the correct one, is marked as wrong flag??

[>] Pretty sure you just got the wrong flag
