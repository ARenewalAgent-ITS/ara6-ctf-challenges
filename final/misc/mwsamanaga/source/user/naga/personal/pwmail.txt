Subject: Research Data Security Protocol Update

From: security@nagai.ai
To: research-team@nagai.ai

Dear Research Team,

To ensure protection of all research materials and data (including encoded files, steganography outputs, and experimental results), please follow these standardized security protocols:

1. All research outputs must use a protection key following this format:
   - One reference name (lowercase)
   - Two digits
   - One special character from: !@#$%

Format: name##symbol

Choose a reference name that's personally meaningful - many researchers use historical figures in their field.

Apply this format for ALL research data protection operations.

Best regards,
Security Team
NagAI Research Division
