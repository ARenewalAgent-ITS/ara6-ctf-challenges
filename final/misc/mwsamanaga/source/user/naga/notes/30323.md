- tasked w/ project fulla
- encryption via NNs, reason was possibly more efficient ways to insert into existing network pipelines
- i.e., have alrd a neural net, encrypt directly in the residual stream instead of externally
- keeps the system tightly coupled

// update: prototype uploaded to `spuun/mwsamanaga`, seems pretty weak, fwiw does exhibit good crypto if not exposed
